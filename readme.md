# AoC18 - Rust

Advent of Code 2018, but in Rust

The idea of this repo is to use it as refresher/learning tool for Rust. AoC puzzles makes use of several data structures and algorithms, so it's a good exercise to skill up a language. 
This repo will be written at the same time as the c# AoC18 ([Github](https://github.com/silentDoc/AoC18))
